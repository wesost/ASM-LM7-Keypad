# Grade and Reflection
Assignment: LM7 Password Keypad    
Date/Time completed:   
Approximate time spent on LM:  

## Instructions
Along with turning in all of the components of the assignment, you are also going to need to complete this Grade and Reflection document. **The goal of this is to aid in finding and focusing on where feedback is needed and to give you space to evaluate your own work.**

This document is not your final grade, but rather an exercise in self-evaluation. We will utilize your reflection when assigning a grade for this assignment.

I would expect you to commit around 15 minutes to this process. Skimming through it ignores the learning opportunity for yourself.

## What went well? What surprised you in a good way? What do you feel proud about?

## What barriers were there? Where was the friction? 

## If you didn't finish, where did you get stuck? What were your next steps going to be?

## Do you have any questions you are going to ask in class and/or in office hours? I.e. do you need any actionable feedback? Remember, you need to initiate the feedback process!
