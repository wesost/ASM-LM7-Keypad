# Grade and Reflection
Assignment: LM7 Password Keypad    
Date/Time completed:   4/20 12:20
Approximate time spent on LM:  11h

## Instructions
Along with turning in all of the components of the assignment, you are also going to need to complete this Grade and Reflection document. **The goal of this is to aid in finding and focusing on where feedback is needed and to give you space to evaluate your own work.**

This document is not your final grade, but rather an exercise in self-evaluation. We will utilize your reflection when assigning a grade for this assignment.

I would expect you to commit around 15 minutes to this process. Skimming through it ignores the learning opportunity for yourself.

## Feedback and Evaluation

Your graded is evaluated on:
  - Good circuit planning
  - Effective implementation of the requirements
  - Well documented code

* Well planned circuit (diagram might be nice)
* Execution of lock
  * password stored in SRAM
  * accurately display progress
  * Lock/Unlocked led functionality
  * both buttons pressed resets lock
* Extra Credit (+15 pts):
  * Long passwords
  * timing elements
* Upload working proof video

## What went well? What surprised you in a good way? What do you feel proud about?
I thought I ended up with a really good understanding of branching and looping and all the commands I used. I also thought 
I was good at being persistent even though it was a very challenging LM for me. 
## What barriers were there? Where was the friction? 
I had a lot of issues where I got stuck and couldn't figure out how to move forward, I went in to office hours at least four times to 
go over things and got a lot of help from Scott. 
## If you didn't finish, where did you get stuck? What were your next steps going to be?
I wasn't able to get the reset function working 100% correctly, so I was going to look further into the resetloop, bothpressed loop, etc to try and figure out the issue.
## Do you have any questions you are going to ask in class and/or in office hours? I.e. do you need any actionable feedback? Remember, you need to initiate the feedback process! 
I think this LM could be completed much easier by using subroutines and things we learned later in class after this LM was due or largely completed, so just having a good grasp of those concepts should be really helpful moving forward.
